# Web-Calculator

## Description
A simple calculator that supports basic arithmetic functions, styled similar to that of iPhones' calculators. Users are not able to enter invalid arithmetic inputs and expressions, and arithmetic evalutations are calculated manually through functions as using the `eval()` function is dangerous to use with untrusted data.

Keyboard support is included too:
- All Clear: escape
- Clear: backspace
- other inputs: their corresponding keys
